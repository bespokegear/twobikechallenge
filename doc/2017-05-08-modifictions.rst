The pair of LED strips are to be replaces with a single strip which will consist of a series of NeoPixel rings (each with 24 LEDs). Each ring represents a city on a map. 

Each city has an energy level. When one of the player's energy levels exceeds this value, the city will be illuminated with the colour of the player who first exceeded that city's colour.

At the end of the race, the winner is the player who has illuminated the most cities. If the number of cities is equal, the final accumulated energy levels for the players will be used to determine the winner.
